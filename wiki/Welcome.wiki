phpivr is an Asterisk AGI application to organize Interactive Voice Responses. It doesn't need extensions.conf changes and dialplan reloading if you want to modify the IVR menu, it reads phpivr.conf on the fly. With phpivr you can build your own IVR logic and put it into Asterisk PBX.
As for me, It has very friendly for understanding config file in JSON format.

Creating of small, flexible and fast tool with simple understandable configuration - main project purpose.
